* Nonogramm has to work:
    * output the fixed amount of squares shaped like a rectangle
    * the user has to click the specific square to get a picture out of the blocks
    * numbers for every column and row will help the user figuring out what picture it is (rules should be known already)
    * by click twice the user can make an x to the square marking there is definitely not the right square to mark
* a timer should output how long the user spent time to solve the puzzle
* if the puzzle is solved, the user get a confirmation

* the user can like other levels or comments
* the user can see if they have completed the puzzle (maybe cookie or sessions, only signed in)

**the criterium can be changed any time**

## update:
this Repository will be postponed, because listing sites without a frontend framework will require the level page and the game page beeing together, so that removing and adding things per dom will be a pain. Especially when paging and other things like helper items and color will go into the mix. The next project will run on a framework. The Nonogramm can be played, but the other levels are in the sign in and about pages and there is no plan for a structured level (if u guys are bothered I can change it)
